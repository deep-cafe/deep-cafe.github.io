- Sometimes people talk about "adulting"
  - the practice of behaving in a way characteristic of a responsible adult, especially the accomplishment of mundane but necessary tasks.

- being an adult is an extension of being a child not a negation of it
  - the people who appear to be the happiest and most fulfilled are those who JOINED the adult world of responsibility and diligent forwardthinking with the childlike world of curiosity, play, wonder, and vulnerable authenticity
  - NOT those who abandoned the child as though it is incompatible with what it means to be an adult

- stages don't exist, there is continuity to our lives
  - if the end of childhood is symbolized by independence from our parents, I'd argue it's really an internalization of the parent
  - whether we are aware of it or not, we embark on the journey of becoming our own parent that is good to us, that nurtures and encourages

- Not:
  - infant
  - child
  - adult
  - elder

- But rather:
  - less experience and self-awareness
  - more experience and self-awareness
  - most experience and self-awareness

- So, instead of "Hi I'm an adult" maybe I can say "Hi, I'm experiencing my 30s!"

- often what drove us as children is what drives us as adults
  - sometimes we lose sight of that as we carve out a professional identity in our twenties
  - we abandon our inner child in the pursuit of success or what we think we should be doing
  - what sometimes ends up happening is a loss of self, a loss of purpose or joy
  - sometimes, its only in our 30s that we learn to reconnect with that inner child and revive an inner purpose

- the importance of play
  - being inquisitve is what leads to creation, understanding, and growth
  - play connects the dots, experiments with new possibilities

- We take care of our current self, and just as importantly, our future self

- We determine our own happiness
  - what that looks like
  - what we need to do to get there
  - parameters
