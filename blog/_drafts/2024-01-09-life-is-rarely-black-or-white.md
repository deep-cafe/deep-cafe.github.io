The Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 was "the moment when the two superpowers [the USA and Soviet Union] came closest to nuclear conflict" <sup>[1](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/cuban-missile-crisis)</sup>. It was the closest we ever got to a war that could have outright destroyed civilization as we know it.

I'm going to call that gray a "delicious gray." Because it makes life so much more interesting. It rewards those who are willing to look deeper. And in the best cases, it creates a glimmer of hope in otherwise dark subject matter.

So what am I getting at exactly and why am I writing about this?
