<!-- the older I get, the more I see the gray in life -->

<!-- example -- fidel castro in DC, loves and respects US culture -->

<!-- enemies -- cuban missile crisis -->

Just a 3 yeas later, USA and Cuba, under Soviet influence, would become mortal enemies in the Cuban Missle Crisis. It's scary to think it was "the moment when the two superpowers [the USA and Soviet Union] came closest to nuclear conflict" <sup>[1](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/cuban-missile-crisis)</sup>.

<!-- not all good or all bad -->

<!-- gray makes life more interesting, more sweet -->

<!-- to be approached with humility, fewer assumptions -->

<!-- a lens to view the world through -->

<!-- a lens to view oneself through when reflecting -->
